# .Layer blog

The objective behind the blog is to make it easy for the community members (and anybody else) to promote their work and share their thoughts and ideas related to the field of data science/machine learning.

## About .Layer
.Layer (dot-layer) is an open community dedicated to promoting collaboration and knowledge sharing in data science.

**Why .Layer?** In Unix operating systems, files beggining with a dot are invisible to the user. Many ignore their purpose, even their existence. In this world where data are queens, data scientists form this hidden layer, invisible to the public. It is now time we say `Hello, World!`

**Implication:** Concretely, we work together for


    1. organizing educational events promoting the sharing of knowledge in data science
    2. promoting ethical uses of data
    3. encouraging the creation of collaborative projects
    4. assisting in the development and proper functioning of projects aiming to disseminate/explain concepts related to data science.
