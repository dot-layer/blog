    "there are differences between the present work and the two others, I've tried to put more insights for the less technical reader in this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequential data, such as an address, are data that we assume are conditional to the previously known information. For example,\n",
    "when writing an address, we know, in Canada, that after the civic number (e.g. 420), we have the street name (e.g. du Lac).\n",
    "That means that if we know the sequence's structure, we can predict the following information. Various modelling approaches have been proposed to make predictions over sequential data. Still, more recently, deep learning models known as Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) has been introduced for this type of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training an RNN requires various tricks (padding and packing) that we will explore in this article. First, let's\n",
    "state our problem, and later on, we will discuss what an actual RNN or LSTM is.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Address Tagging\n",
    "Address tagging is the task of detecting, by tagging, the different parts of an address such as the civic number,\n",
    "the street name or the postal code (or zip code). The following figure shows an example of such a tagging.\n",
    "\n",
    "![address parsing canada](address_parsing.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since addresses are written in a predetermined sequence, RNN is the best way to crack this problem. But to decode the output of the RNN, we also need another component, a fully-connected layer.\n",
    "So, our architecture, we will be composed of an RNN and a fully-connected layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## RNN\n",
    "Speaking of RNN, what is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "In brief, RNN is neural networks where connections between nodes form a temporal sequence. It means that this type of networks\n",
    "allow previous outputs to be used as inputs of the previous information\n",
    "([For more about RNN](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-230/cheatsheet-recurrent-neural-networks)).\n",
    "\n",
    "But, instead of using a vanilla RNN, we use a variant of it, know as a long short-term memory (LSTM) that is known to have\n",
    "better stability with gradient update (vanishing and exploding gradient) by using gates\n",
    "([to learn more about LSTM](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, for now, let's simply use a single layer unidirectional LSTM. We will, later on, explore the use of more layers and bidirectional approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our data is text, we will use a well-known word encoding technique, word embeddings. Word embeddings are vectors\n",
    "representation of words. The main hypothesis is that words have a linear relation along with them. For example, the linear relation\n",
    "between the word `king` and `queen` is gender. So logically, if we remove the vector of `male` to `king` and add the vector\n",
    "of `female`, we should obtain the vector of `queen`. That been said; usually, those kind of representation are in dimension `300`, which\n",
    "make it impossible for humans to reason about. Still, the idea is there but in a larger dimension space.\n",
    "\n",
    "So our LSTM input and hidden state dimensions will be of the same size as the word vectors.\n",
    "This size corresponds to the word embeddings dimension, which in our case will be the\n",
    "[French pre trained](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/crawl-vectors.html) fastText embeddings of dimension `300`.\n",
