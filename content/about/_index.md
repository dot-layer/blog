.Layer (dot-layer) is an open community dedicated to promoting collaboration and knowledge sharing in data science.

**Why .Layer?** In Unix operating systems, files beggining with a dot are invisible to the user. Many ignore their purpose, even their existence. In this world where data are queens, *data scientists* form this hidden layer, invisible to the public. It is now time we say `Hello, World!`

**Implication:** Concretely, we work together for

  - organizing educational events promoting the sharing of knowledge in data science
  - promoting ethical uses of data
  - encouraging the creation of collaborative projects
  - assisting in the development and proper functioning of projects aiming to disseminate/explain concepts related to data science.
  
**Our story:** 

During the summer of 2018, around fifteen people, friends of friends passionate about *machine learning* gathered in a chalet in Charlevoix.
The objective was to create a platform to promote collaboration between the various actors in the field (in Quebec City).
An unfortunate patio screen accident later (as we see too often), .Layer had his name and a collaborative project to promote collaborative projects was born.
We were already talking about creating a non-profit organization (NPO) to manage our activities.

2019 marked the "official" birth of the NPO with a first board of directors and the creation of different committees.
At the time of the second edition of the legendary "chalet", a [blog](dotlayer.org) was operational, [Meetup Machine Learning QuÃ©bec](https://www.facebook.com/MeetupMLQuebec/) (conferences, workshops, hackothon) was already an integral part of the ecosystem and the first episodes of the [OpenLayer podcast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB3tYpZ1ojiqAroyDN05Cyw) had just been broadcast. The rest of the story is to be written. We are waiting for you, don't hesitate to contact us if you want to get involved!
