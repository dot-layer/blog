.Layer is a data science oriented community created for promoting collaboration and knowledge sharing among its members. In Unix-like operating systems, files and folders starting with a *dot* are treated as hidden, invisible to the passerby. Most people don't even know their existence and purpose. In a world where people produce data and live the outcomes of many performing algorithms, data scientists form, much like *dot* files, a hidden layer working behind the scenes. Now is the time that we, data scientists, say: `Hello, World!`

The objective behind the blog is to make it easy for the community members to share their work, thoughts and ideas related to data science and machine learning.
