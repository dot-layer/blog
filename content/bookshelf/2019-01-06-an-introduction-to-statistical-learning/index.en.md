# Summary

This book is mostly interested in supervised learning, the task of
using statistical models to predict the relationship between
predictors and a response. Given there is a function $f$ that
provides a relationship between explanatory variables $X$ and a
response variable $Y$, what are statistical methods for estimating
$f$.

# Review

There are two steps in the education of a data scientist :
understanding statistical models, and putting them in practice.
This book definitely helps on the practice part, assuming little
mathematical or statistical knowledge from the reader. This book
is a great companion to it's big brother, The Elements of Statistical
Learning. First of all, R is a great language to start with
statistical learning as it's really easy to manipulate data.

Exercices are simple but labs are great for understanding and as a
way to

I particularly liked their chapter 5, treating resampling methods.
Most of us know what $k$-fold cross validation is, but how and why
it works isn't understood by all. This chapter helps us understand
the bias-variance tradeoff for the choice of $k$ in the method. This
is an example of a situation does not only show the method, but
also examines their statistical properties, something not all machine
learning books do.
